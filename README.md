# RSVD
randomized singular value decomposition


Code to generate a randomized SVD approximation to a full SVD of a matrix H of size m by m.

This is done through the use of a matrix Omega of size m by l with random normal contents,
and the projection of H onto the orthonormal basis obtained from a QR decomposition
of a matrix Y, which is a m by l sized sketch of H.

In the calculation of the randomized SVD, we avoid using the matrix H itself
and instead use its inverse J.

For more information on the method please refer to
    **Ribeiro, Yeh, and Taira arXiv 2019* and *Halko, Martinsson and Tropp 2009*.

For details regarding the linear algebra involved I cannot recommend
Trefethen and Bau's book highly enough.
